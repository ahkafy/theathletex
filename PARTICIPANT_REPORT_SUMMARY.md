### Dynamic Additional Fields Support
The system automatically detects and displays ALL custom fields from the event registration form:

**In Detailed View:**
- Shows as a separate card "Additional Registration Fields"
- Displays field labels (formatted from keys)
- Shows values with proper formatting (badges for multi-select)

**In CSV Export:**
- Automatically detects all unique field keys across participants
- Creates columns for each additional field
- Shows "N/A" for participants without specific fields
- Handles arrays (multi-select) by joining with semicolons

**Example:**
If events have custom fields like:
- "Previous Marathon Experience"
- "Dietary Restrictions"
- "Emergency Medical Information"
- "Team Member Names"

All of these will automatically appear in:
- ✅ The detailed participant view
- ✅ The CSV export with proper column headers

3. **Easy Export:** One-click CSV with all data for spreadsheets

5. **Quick Actions:** Email, call, view full profile from list
