# Quick Reference: Additional Fields & Export Filter

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Added "Additional Fields" Column to Participants List
Shows a preview of custom registration form data directly in the table!

**Before:**
```
# | Participant ID | Name | Event | Personal | Address | Registration | Payment | Actions
```

**After:**
```
# | Participant ID | Name | Event | Personal | Additional Fields | Address | Registration | Payment | Actions
                                                    ⭐ NEW COLUMN
```

### 2. Export Already Filters by Event ✅
The export button already worked correctly - it passes all filters including:
- Event filter
- Category filter  
- Payment status filter
