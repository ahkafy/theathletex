# Bug Fixes Summary - October 19, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Homepage Not Showing Events

**Problem:**
- `HomeController@index()` was querying events with `status = 'active'`
- Event status values are: `'scheduled'`, `'open'`, `'closed'`, `'complete'`
- No events have status `'active'`, so homepage showed empty

**Fix:**
```php
// Before
$events = Event::with('fees')->where('status', 'active')->get();

// After
$events = Event::with('fees')->where('status', 'open')->orderBy('start_time', 'desc')->get();
```

**File Changed:** `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`

**Result:** Homepage now shows all events with status `'open'`

---

### 2. ✅ Events Sub-Pages Working Correctly

**Status:** Already working correctly

**Verified Pages:**
- **All Events** (`/events`) - Shows all events regardless of status ✓
- **Upcoming Events** (`/events/upcoming`) - Shows events where `start_time > now()` ✓
- **Past Events** (`/events/past`) - Shows events where `end_time < now()` ✓

**Files Checked:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`
- `resources/views/events/all.blade.php`
- `resources/views/events/upcoming.blade.php`
- `resources/views/events/past.blade.php`

---

### 3. ✅ Participant ID Format Changed to 7-Digit

**Problem:**
- Participant ID was using 8-digit serial number
- Required format: EventID + 7-digit serial number

**Fix:**
```php
// Before
$serialNumber = str_pad($participantCount + 1, 8, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
// Example: Event ID 5 → 500000001

// After
$serialNumber = str_pad($participantCount + 1, 7, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
// Example: Event ID 5 → 50000001
```

**File Changed:** `app/Models/Participant.php`

**Format Examples:**
- Event ID 1, 1st participant → `10000001`
- Event ID 1, 100th participant → `10000100`
- Event ID 25, 1st participant → `250000001`
- Event ID 25, 5000th participant → `250005000`

---

### 4. ✅ Participant ID Added to SMS Confirmation

**Problem:**
- SMS confirmation did not include participant ID
- Participants couldn't easily identify their registration

**Fix:**
```php
// Before
$msg = "Dear " . $trxInfo->participant->name . ", your payment of " . $trxInfo->amount . " " . $trxInfo->currency . " for the event has been successfully completed. Transaction ID: " . $tran_id . ". Thank you for your participation!";

// After
$msg = "Dear " . $trxInfo->participant->name . ", your payment of " . $trxInfo->amount . " " . $trxInfo->currency . " for " . $trxInfo->event->name . " has been successfully completed. Your Participant ID: " . $trxInfo->participant->participant_id . ". Transaction ID: " . $tran_id . ". Thank you for your participation!";
```

**File Changed:** `app/Http/Controllers/SslCommerzPaymentController.php`

**Sample SMS:**
```
Dear John Doe, your payment of 1500 BDT for Marathon 2025 has been successfully completed. Your Participant ID: 10000001. Transaction ID: 123456. Thank you for your participation!
```

### 5. ✅ Participant ID Added to Email Confirmation

**Problem:**
- Email confirmation did not prominently display participant ID
- Participants need this ID for event day check-in

**Fix:**
Added participant ID to both HTML and text email templates with prominent styling.

**HTML Email (`payment-confirmation.blade.php`):**
```html
<p><strong>Participant ID:</strong> 
   <span style="color: #007bff; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">
      {{ $participant->participant_id }}
   </span>
</p>
```

**Text Email (`payment-confirmation-text.blade.php`):**
```
Participant ID: {{ $participant->participant_id }}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `resources/views/emails/payment-confirmation.blade.php`
- `resources/views/emails/payment-confirmation-text.blade.php`

**Email Display:**
- Participant ID shown in blue, bold, larger font
- Displayed right after order number
- Appears before event category and total amount

## Testing Checklist

### Homepage (/)
- [ ] Open browser and go to homepage
- [ ] Verify "Open Events" section shows events with status='open'
- [ ] Verify event cards show correct info (name, status, date, cover photo)
- [ ] Click "Register Now" button - should redirect to OTP form

### Events Pages
- [ ] Go to `/events` - should show all events
- [ ] Go to `/events/upcoming` - should show future events
- [ ] Go to `/events/past` - should show past events

### Participant ID Format
- [ ] Create a new test event in admin panel
- [ ] Register a test participant
- [ ] Complete payment
- [ ] Check database: `participants` table
- [ ] Verify `participant_id` format: EventID + 7-digit serial
- [ ] Example: If event_id is 5, first participant should be `50000001`

### SMS Confirmation
- [ ] Register and complete payment for an event
- [ ] Check received SMS message
- [ ] Verify SMS contains:
   - Participant name
   - Payment amount and currency
   - Event name
   - **Participant ID** (new)
   - Transaction ID

### Email Confirmation
- [ ] Register and complete payment for an event
- [ ] Check received email

## Database Verification

To verify participant IDs in database:

```sql
-- Check participant IDs format
SELECT 
    id,
    event_id,
    participant_id,
    name,
    LENGTH(participant_id) as id_length,
    created_at
FROM participants
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected result:
-- id_length should show total digits (event_id + 7)
-- Example: event_id=5 → participant_id should be like 50000001 (8 digits total)
```

---

## Production Deployment

### No migration needed
These are code-only changes. No database schema changes required.

### Deployment Steps:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear

# 3. Test the fixes
# - Visit homepage
# - Check events pages
# - Register a test participant (if possible)
# - Verify email/SMS format
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **Existing Participant IDs:**
   - Participants registered before this fix will still have 8-digit serial numbers
   - New participants (after deployment) will have 7-digit serial numbers
   - This is **not** a problem - both formats work fine
   - If consistency is critical, existing participants can be regenerated (requires careful data migration)

2. **Event Status:**
   - Make sure events have correct status in admin panel
   - Status values: `scheduled`, `open`, `closed`, `complete`
   - Homepage shows only `open` events
   - Change event status to `open` to make it visible on homepage

3. **SMS Delivery:**
   - SMS service must be active and configured
   - Test SMS sending after deployment
   - Check logs if SMS fails: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

4. **Email Delivery:**
   - AWS SES must be configured (already done previously)
   - Test email sending after deployment
   - Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive
